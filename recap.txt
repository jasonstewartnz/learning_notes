challenge: install presto db
call it from python
build something that reads from the net and puts it in a database

# may not be best practice
$PATH=`cat newpath.txt`

# create sub-terminal
bash --login


# idea should be to rerun .bashrc and start that file with deleting the PATH and rebuilding

# etc is configuration folder

# create
python -m venv /path/to/directory
or 
virtualenv airflow2

source ./.venv/airflow/bin/activate

copied Airflow install script to airflow_install_script.sh
set user execute permissions with chmod
chmod u+x airflow_install_script.sh

# busybox

docker pull busybox
docker images
# run a command within the container
docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"

# running interactively with sh
docker run -it busybox sh
# It makes sense to spend some time getting comfortable with it. 
# To find out more about run, use docker run --help to see a list of all flags it supports.

# clean up exited containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
--rm flag that can be passed to docker run which automatically deletes the container once it's exited from.
you can also delete images that you no longer need by running docker rmi.
