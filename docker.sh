# Set up Dockerâ€™s package repository.

# Download latest DEB package.

# Install the package with apt as follows:
sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.deb
sudo apt-get install ~/Downloads/docker-desktop-4.15.0-amd64.deb

# This message shows at the end of the install
# N: Download is performed unsandboxed as root as file '/home/jasonstewartnz/Downloads/docker-desktop-4.15.0-amd64.deb' couldn't be accessed by user '_apt'. - pkgAcquire::Run (13: Permission denied)

# The post-install script:
# These steps not done
#     Sets the capability on the Docker Desktop binary to map privileged ports and set resource limits.
#     Adds a DNS name for Kubernetes to /etc/hosts.
#     Creates a link from /usr/bin/docker to /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli.

# however, the following works:
systemctl --user start docker-desktop
# but, it just says Docker Desktop starting
# followed these instructions (using vs code to craeate the files)
# https://github.com/docker/desktop-linux/issues/51#issuecomment-1200774715
# found via https://askubuntu.com/questions/1415053/docker-desktop-stuck-at-docker-desktop-starting

# rebooted. then had some weird issue that seems to have ironed itself out
# note that installing docker desktop effectively kills all the existing containers, so better to do that before starting


# 
# so I am returning to my getting-started/app folder and rerunning
docker build -t getting-started .

## Volumes: introduction
# Reference: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/
# execute command within the container
docker volume create todo-db

# start the container, but mount the volume
docker run -dp 3000:3000 --mount type=volume,src=todo-db,target=/etc/todos getting-started

# While running in Docker Desktop, the Docker commands are actually 
# running inside a small VM on your machine. If you wanted to look 
# at the actual contents of the Mount point directory, you would need to look inside of that VM.

## Using bind mounts
# https://docs.docker.com/get-started/06_bind_mounts/
# google search: docker bind mount vs volume
# 
 # Docker manages Volumes and is usually not affected by other processes running
 # on the same host. In contrast, Bind Mounts are just a directory on the 
 # host file system and may be modified by other processes other than docker.

 # So for example, if we wanted to trigger some particular behaviour from an 
 # external process (e.g. Airflow controlled flag file) or inject some code at 
 # runtime, we could use a bing mount. 
 # When we want to ensure the integrity of some data within the context of a set
 # of cotainers, we would use a volume mount (e.g. shared database). Still want to
 # understand if/how we can mount an external volume such as an S3 bucket.

 # https://docs.docker.com/get-started/06_bind_mounts/#quick-volume-type-comparisons

 # E.g. you could have a bunch of machines waiting to perform a particular 
 # class of tasks/requests, say data pipeline tasks they could all work
 # with the same volume (e.g. database) to track what has been done and what is needed 
 # to do. We wouldn't want an external resource to interfere with this, and the volume 
 # could be called something like etl-pipeline-status (or be the airflow shared db)
 # which would be monitored by containers from the etl-images, and other images responsible 
 # for the management/addition of tasks, and dags, but which may be different images or
 # different run commands for the contains that include a bind mount.
 # TODO: Diagram this

# https://docs.docker.com/storage/images/types-of-mounts-volume.png

## trying out bind mounts
docker run -it --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/src ubuntu bash

ls src # inspect contents and confirm they match to ~/projects/docker/getting-started

# Run your app in a development container
# from within getting-started/app
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
    -w /app --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/app \
    node:18-alpine \
    sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"

# Using bind mounts is common for local development setups.

# @todo

# Multi-container apps / container networking
# In general, each container should do one thing and do it well. 

# Rule
# If two containers are on the same network, they can talk to each other. 
# If they arenâ€™t, they canâ€™t.
